Hi there. This site is a place for me to combine two of my passions: ice hockey and data analysis. I started playing hockey when I was three, and still play to this day at the league where all hockey players end up: beer league. On top of that, I am a USA hockey referee - plenty of skating for me in the fall and winter months. 

On the other side, my day job is in the field of data analytics. I love exploring data and uncovering relationships and explanations. One of my favorite parts of the analysis is using data visualizations to tell a story. 

That's it for now. Feel free to [drop me an email](https://iceanalysis.com/contact) and follow on twitter for updates [@IceAnalysis](https://twitter.com/IceAnalysis)
